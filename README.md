  ## About
  
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a comprehensive and quality README section. It should include
  information about the app, how it is used, installation instructions, how contributions to the project can be made, and licensing information. This command-line application allows for a quick and easy generation of a README for the user, so that they can spend more time on the project, while also having a high-quality README.
